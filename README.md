# obsidian-auto-glossary
Obsidian plugin that allows user to create:
- a glossary of files (list of `![[link]]`)
- an index (or MOC) of files (list of `[[link]]`)
- a glossary with an index (two lists above concatenated)

Right now in a very simple version

## TO-DO
- [ ] option to choose order of notes in the created file
- [ ] file creation by right click on folder
- [ ] option to create a file divided with sub-directories or tag
***
- [x] option to choose file name + eventual default naming system
- [x] modal with options for index, glossary or both
- [x] what happens if a file with the same name already exists?
